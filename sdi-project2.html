<p>I chose to tell a story about the xbox game my 6 year old plays constantly called Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.</p>
<p>The game itself comes with a unit that you plug into your xbox via usb and you literally just put the toy figurine on it and it will be transported into the game where you can play as that character. </p>
<p>There's a total of 32 characters and we're working on collecting them all which is an addiction in itself!</p>
