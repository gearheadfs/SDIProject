    <h2>Project 3</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>I decided to continue with the story regarding the video game that my son and I like to play together, Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.</p>
<p>Most of my time working on this project has been devoted to creating json data within my object. I have followed the wimba example to a tee and am still getting errors.</p>
<p>My error that's happening is I can call the first character, Spyro just fine. But beyond him it's telling me they are undefined and I cannot for the life of me
figure out why. I have to assume it's a semi-colon or a curly bracket somewhere.</p>
